## ðŸ”§ Integration Examples

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// React component example
const ResumeGenerator = () => {
  const [jobDescription, setJobDescription] = useState('');
  const [generateCoverLetter, setGenerateCoverLetter] = useState(true);
  
  const generateResume = async (personalData) => {
    const request = {
      ...personalData,
      jobDescription: parseJobDescription(jobDescription),
      generateCoverLetter,
      includeAiReview: true,
      outputFormat: 'Html'
    };
    
    const response = await fetch('/api/resume/generate', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(request)
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    return result;
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <textarea 
        placeholder="Paste job description here..."
        value={jobDescription}
        onChange={(e) => setJobDescription(e.target.value)}
      />
      <label>
        <input 
          type="checkbox" 
          checked={generateCoverLetter}
          onChange={(e) => setGenerateCoverLetter(e.target.checked)}
        />
        Generate Cover Letter
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Generate Tailored Resume</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Job Description Parser

```javascript
// Utility to parse job postings from various formats
const parseJobDescription = (text) => {
  // Extract structured data from job posting text
  const lines = text.split('\n');
  
  const jobData = {
    jobTitle: extractJobTitle(lines),
    company: extractCompany(lines),
    description: text,
    requiredSkills: extractSkills(text, 'required'),
    preferredSkills: extractSkills(text, 'preferred'),
    responsibilities: extractResponsibilities(text)
  };
  
  return jobData;
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Performance Considerations

### Processing Time Estimates
- **Resume Only**: 15-30 seconds
- **Resume + Cover Letter**: 25-45 seconds  
- **Full Package with Analysis**: 35-60 seconds

### Token Usage
- **Job-Tailored Resume**: ~2-3x standard resume tokens
- **Cover Letter**: ~1,500-2,000 tokens
- **Job Match Analysis**: ~1,000-1,500 tokens

### Cost Optimization
- Use job description caching for similar roles
- Implement smart batching for multiple applications
- Optional AI review for cost-sensitive scenarios
